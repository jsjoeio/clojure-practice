# clojure-practice

A bunch of Clojure exercises for me to practice writing Clojure.

*Note: this project uses [hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) to scaffold new exercises. To create a new exercise, run `npx hygen file new <name>`*

To run a single test suite, run:
```sh
lein test :only clojure-practice.<namespace>-test

# example for the functions test
lein test :only clojure-practice.functions-test
```
